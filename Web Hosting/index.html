                Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
            </h3>
            <p class="para">

                Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover
                without
                requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.
                Older
                people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
                respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with
                COVID-19
                and become seriously ill or die at any age.
            </p>
            <p class="para">

                The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the
                virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others,
                wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get
                vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough,

                sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller
                aerosols.
                It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to
                stay
                home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.
